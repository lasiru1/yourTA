## Purpose 
Which UC Campus is best at recycling? 
yourTA's goal is to embed various sensors within all major campus recycling bins.
These sensors include photoresistors and ultrasonic to determine when a new item 
has entered a bin and that a new capture needs to be taken. A dynamic web server 
will incorporate this data into realtime analysis and feature a leaderboard for 
comparing recycling efficiency among  all the UC campuses.

## Upcoming Features for Version 2.0
Instead of focusing on the rate at which recycling bins are filled, photo 
recognition will also determine the quality of recycling. Photos of the items 
entering a recycling bin will be taken and analyzed to determine whether it is 
a legitimate item that can be reprocessed. Items that fail will reduce the 
the overall grade of the campus.

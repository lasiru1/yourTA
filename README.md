## Purpose 
Which UC Campus is best at recycling? 
yourTA's goal is to embed various sensors within all major campus  
recycling bins. These sensors include motion, light, and ultrasound to determine 
the rate at which they are filled. A dynamic web server will incorporate this 
data into realtime analysis and feature a leaderboard for comparing rates 
between all the UC campuses. 

## Upcoming Features for Version 2.0
Instead of focusing on the rate at which recycling bins are filled, photo 
recognition will also determine the quality of recycling. Photos of the items 
entering a recycling bin will be taken and analyzed to determine whether it is 
a legitimate item that can be reprocessed. Items that fail will reduce the 
the overall grade of the campus.
